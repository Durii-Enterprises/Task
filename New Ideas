Backpack inventory as a stack, so only the uppermost items can be accessed?

ingame merchants-
  instead of having merchants and a currency like gold, instead have the player have run-ins with other NPC "players"
  that you play with, and having a barter system. so each item still has to have value but your Karma with other 'players' dictates the quality of trades avalible.
